# Heart-Disease-ML-project
Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, making early detection and risk assessment
crucial for improving patient outcomes. This project utilizes the Heart Failure Prediction Dataset,
which contains clinical and demographic information about patients, including features such as age,
cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, and maximum heart rate achieved, along with a target
variable indicating the presence of heart disease.
The project aims to explore the dataset, uncover patterns through visualization, and develop
machine learning models to predict heart failure risk. The analysis begins with data cleaning and
preprocessing to prepare the dataset, followed by training and evaluating classifiers, including
Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, KNN, and Decision Trees. Additionally, a dendrogram will be constructed to
visualize hierarchical clustering relationships, providing insights into how patient groups are
naturally formed based on their attributes.
